# What's New in IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm 7.4?
 
IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm is a complete development environment for Arm-based microcontrollers, generating fast, compact code and enabling you to take full control of your code. The latest version, 7.4, introduces several new features and enhancements that make it even more powerful and user-friendly.

## Support for new devices
 
The toolchain supports more than 8,000 Arm devices from all major vendors and selected 64-bit Arm cores. Version 7.4 adds support for new devices such as:
 
- STMicroelectronics STM32F446xx
- NXP LPC5410x
- Atmel SAM D21
- Texas Instruments TMS570LC43x
- Silicon Labs EFM32 Happy Gecko

You can find the complete list of supported devices on the [IAR website](https://www.iar.com/products/architectures/arm/iar-embedded-workbench-for-arm/).
 
## Improved code analysis
 
The toolchain includes integrated code analysis add-ons that help you to ensure code quality throughout the development and testing process. C-STAT is a static analysis tool that checks compliance with coding standards such as MISRA C:2012 and CERT C, as well as detects potential errors, bugs and security vulnerabilities. C-RUN is a runtime analysis tool that checks for arithmetic issues, bounds issues and heap integrity.
 
Version 7.4 improves the performance and accuracy of both C-STAT and C-RUN, as well as adds new checks and options. For example, C-STAT now supports MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 and allows you to exclude files or folders from analysis. C-RUN now supports heap usage statistics and allows you to configure heap size and alignment.

## Enhanced debugger
 
The C-SPY Debugger provides an Arm instruction simulator and extensive support for debugging probes and target systems. It includes RTOS plugins and wide support for communication stacks and middleware, as well as a C-like macro system. In addition, it offers multicore debugging with support for symmetric multicore processing (SMP) and asymmetric multicore processing (AMP).
 
Version 7.4 enhances the debugger with new features such as:

- Support for ETM trace on Cortex-M7 devices
- Support for SWO trace on Cortex-M0+ devices
- Support for ULINKpro D debug probe from Keil
- Support for Segger J-Link v5 debug probe
- New Timeline window that shows power consumption, execution time and event history
- New Function Profiler window that shows power consumption, execution time and call graph per function

## User-friendly IDE
 
The toolchain comes with a user-friendly IDE that includes project management tools and editor. It also provides 8,400 example projects containing configuration files, code examples and project templates, giving every project a quick start.
 
Version 7.4 improves the IDE with new features such as:

- Support for Visual Studio Code extensions that allow you to use VS Code as an editor while still using IAR Embedded Workbench for building and debugging
- Support for Git version control system that allows you to manage your source code changes easily
- New Project Connection window that allows you to connect to remote projects on a server or in the cloud
- New Project Merge tool that allows you to merge changes from different project versions or branches
- New Project Compare tool that allows you to compare project settings or files between different projects or versions
