Bioshock is not just a game, it's a masterpiece of storytelling and art. The game takes you to a world where science has gone too far, and where a man named Andrew Ryan has created a utopia for the elite and the ambitious. But something has gone wrong, and Rapture is now a nightmare of violence and madness.
 
You play as Jack, a plane crash survivor who finds himself in Rapture, with no memory of who he is or why he is there. Along the way, you will encounter various characters, such as Atlas, a rebel leader who guides you through the city; Tenenbaum, a scientist who tries to save the Little Sisters, genetically modified girls who harvest a substance called ADAM; and Fontaine, a ruthless businessman who wants to take over Rapture.
 
You will also have to face the Splicers, the former citizens of Rapture who have become addicted to ADAM and have mutated into grotesque creatures. And you will have to deal with the Big Daddies, armored guardians who protect the Little Sisters from harm. You will have to decide whether to save or harvest the Little Sisters, which will affect the game's ending.
 
Bioshock is a game that will challenge your morals, your skills, and your imagination. It is a game that will make you question everything you see and hear. It is a game that will stay with you long after you finish it.

Bioshock is not just a game, it's also a franchise that has spawned two sequels and a prequel. Bioshock 2 takes place eight years after the first game, and lets you play as a Big Daddy who has to find his Little Sister. Bioshock Infinite takes place in 1912, and transports you to a floating city called Columbia, where you have to rescue a mysterious girl named Elizabeth. Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea is a two-part DLC that connects the stories of Rapture and Columbia, and lets you play as both Booker and Elizabeth.
