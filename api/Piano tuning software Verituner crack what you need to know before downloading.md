In this article, we will show you how to use Verituner software to tune your piano, and also how to get it for free with a crack. But before we do that, let's see why Verituner is different from other piano tuning software.
 
## What Makes Verituner Software Unique?
 
Verituner software is not just a simple tuner that tells you if a note is too high or too low. It is a sophisticated tool that analyzes the entire scaling of the piano and adjusts the tuning targets for each note and partial accordingly. This means that Verituner can compensate for the natural variations and inconsistencies in the string tension, length, diameter, and stiffness that affect the pitch and tone of each note.
 
Verituner software also allows you to customize the amount of stretch in your tuning through its Style option. Stretch is the deviation from equal temperament that makes octaves sound more consonant and pleasing to the ear. Verituner has three built-in Styles: Normal, Wide, and Narrow, that you can choose from depending on your preference and the type of piano you are tuning. You can also create your own Custom Styles with the Style Designer feature.
 
Another advantage of Verituner software is that it is available on three platforms: iPhone, Android, and Windows-based netbooks. You can download the app or the software from the official website or from the app stores. You can also use any external microphone or clip-on tuner to connect your device to the piano.
 
## How to Use Verituner Software to Tune Your Piano
 
Using Verituner software to tune your piano is easy and fast. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Select your device and platform and download Verituner software from [the official website](https://www.veritune.com/) [^1^] or from the app store.
2. Connect your device to an external microphone or clip-on tuner and place it near the piano.
3. Open Verituner software and select your Style option. You can also adjust other settings such as temperament, pitch standard, transposition, etc.
4. Start tuning by playing A4 (the A above middle C) on the piano. Verituner will automatically identify the note and octave and display the tuning display for that note.
5. Adjust the tuning pin of A4 until the spinner slows down as much as possible. The spinner shows you how far you are from the target pitch in cents (hundredths of a semitone). You can also see a numerical value of your cents offset below the spinner.
6. Move on to other notes by playing them on the piano. Verituner will follow your tuning sequence and show you the tuning display for each note. You can tune any note in any order, but it is recommended to tune octaves first, then fifths, then thirds, then other intervals.
7. When you are done tuning all 88 notes, you can check your tuning by playing chords, scales, or songs on the piano. You can also use Verituner's Pitch Check feature to compare your tuning with a reference tone.

## How to Get Verituner Software for Free with a Crack
 
If you want to use Verituner software without paying for it, you can try to find a crack online. A crack is a modified version of a software that bypasses its security features and allows you to use it for free. However, using a crack is illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your device or compromise your personal information.
